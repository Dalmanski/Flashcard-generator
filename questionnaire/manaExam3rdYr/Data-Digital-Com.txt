>Refers to any piece of information that can be stored, processed, and transmitted.

?Data

>Involves the electronic exchange of data between devices or systems. It uses digital signals, which are discrete, rather than analog signals, which are continuous.

?Digital Communication

>Is the process of varying one or more parameters of a carrier signal in accordance with the instantaneous values of the message signal.

?Modulation

>The amplitude of the sound wave is sampled at regular intervals and translated into a binary number.

?Pulse Code Modulation (PCM)

>The difference between the original analog signal and the translated digital signal is called _____

?Quantizing error

>Is a process of reducing the excessive bits and confining the data.

?Quantizing

>This is the technique which helps to collect the sample data at instantaneous values of the message signal, so as to reconstruct the original signal.

?Sampler

>This filter eliminates the high frequency components present in the input analog signal which is greater than the highest frequency of the message signal, to avoid aliasing of the message signal.

?Low Pass Filter

>It designates each quantized level by a binary code.

?Encoder

>This section increases the signal strength.

?Regenerative Repeater

>Decodes the pulse coded waveform to reproduce the original signal. This circuit acts as the demodulator.

>Is adding information to a carrier signal.

?Modulation

>The sine wave on which the characteristics of the information signal are modulated is called a ______.

?Carrier Signal

>Converting digital or analog information to a waveform suitable for transmission over a given medium

?Modulation

>The variation in the parameter of the carrier is continuous in accordance with the input analog signal.

?Analog Modulation

>The variation in the parameter of the carrier is discrete.

?Digital Modulation

>The amplitude of the signal is changed in response to information and all else is kept fixed.

?Amplitude Shift Keying

>the frequency is changed in response to information.

?Frequency Shift Keying

>The phase of the sinusoidal carrier is changed to indicate information. Phase in this context is the starting angle at which the sinusoidal starts

?Phase Shift Keying

>Refers to the reduction of uncertainty. When you receive a message, it reduces the uncertainty about something.

?Information

>Is a measure of the uncertainty or randomness in a system. In Information Theory, it quantifies the amount of information in a message.

?Entropy

>This refers to the repetition or predictability in a message.

?Redundancy

>This is the maximum rate at which information can be reliably transmitted over a communication channel. It depends on factors like the bandwidth of the channel and the noise present.

?Channel Capacity

>Refers to anything that interferes with the transmission and reception of the message, leading to errors.

?Noise

>It relates the channel capacity to bandwidth and signal-to-noise ratio

?Shannon-Hartley Theorem

>It states that reliable communication is possible up to a certain rate, known as the channel capacity, even in the presence of noise.
