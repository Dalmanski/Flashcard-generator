# Lesson 5

$ A ___________ is a digital sequential circuit and here it is a 4 bit counter, which simply means it can count from 0 to 15 and vice versa based upon the direction of counting (up/down).
%counter

$ A ___________ is an asynchronous counter in which the preceding flop's output clocks all the flops except the first.
%ripple counter

$ _________ means all the elements of the circuits do not have a common clock. 
%Asynchronous

$ A ___________ is a digital circuit with a series of flip flops connected in a feedback manner.
%ring counter

$ ___________ is composed of Shift Registers. The data pattern will re-circulate as long as clock pulses are applied.
%ring counter

$ The ___________ starts incrementing from 4'b0000 to 4'h1111 and come back to 4'b0000.
%4-bit counter

$ ___________ are sequential logic devices that follow a predetermined sequence of counting states triggered by an external clock (CLK) signal. 
%counters

$ The number of states or counting sequences through which a particular counter advances before returning to its original first state is called the ___________.
%modulus (MOD)

$ is the number of states the counter counts and is the dividing number of the counter.
%modulus (MOD)

$ ___________ are defined based on the number of states that the counter will sequence before returning to its original value.
%Modulus Counters

$ A ___________ is a digital circuit with a series of flip flops connected in a feedback manner.
%Johnson counter

$ is a counter that counts 2N states if the number of bits is N.
%Johnson counter

$ passes blocks of four logic "0" and then four logic "1" thereby producing an 8-bit pattern.
%4-bit Johnson ring counter

$ can also be used to divide the clock signal frequency by varying their feedback connections, and divide-by-3 or divide-by-5 outputs are also available.
%Standard 2, 3 or 4-stage Johnson Ring Counters

$ such as the commonly available CD4017, is generally used as a synchronous decade counter/divider circuit.
%standard 5-stage Johnson counter

$ can be used to produce four individual outputs that are each 90 degrees out-of-phase for each other to produce a 4-phase timing signal.
%Quadrature Oscillator or Generator

$ ___________ is a kind of binary number system where only one bit will change at a time.
%Gray code

$is also useful in design and verification in the VLSI domain.
%Gray counter

$ In ___________, the number of changes in different coordinate positions is as close as possible.
%balanced Gray codes

$ is uniform or uniformly balanced if its transition counts are all equal.
%gray code

$ can also be exponentially balanced if all of their transition counts are adjacent powers of two, and such codes exist for every power of two.
%gray code

$ One such type of Gray code is the ___________, also known as a non-Boolean Gray code.
%n-ary Gray code

$ may be constructed recursively, as the BRGC, or may be constructed iteratively.
%(n, k)-Gray code

$ ___________ are useful in interconnection networks theory, especially for minimizing dilation for linear arrays of processors.
%Monotonic codes

$ Another type of Gray code, the ___________, is named for Irish playwright Samuel Beckett, who was interested in symmetry.
%Beckett-Gray code

$ ___________, or snakes, are the sequences of nodes of induced paths in an n-dimensional hypercube graph.
%Snake-in-the-box codes

$ The ___________ is a cyclical list of P unique binary encodings of length n such that two consecutive words differ in exactly one position.
%Single-track Gray Code (STGC)

$ ___________ are used in communication to minimize the number of bit errors in quadrature amplitude modulation adjacent points in the constellation.
%Two-dimensional Gray codes

# Lesson 6

$ ___________ is used to recognize patterns.
%Finite state machine

$ ___________ can be define as finite set of states multiplied by finite set of input symbol. 
%Transition function

$ ___________ refers to the uniqueness of the computation.
%DFA

$ ___________ it is used to transit the any number of states for a particular input.
%NDFA

$ accepts the NULL move that means it can change state without reading the symbols.
%NDFA

# Lesson 7

$ A ___________ is meant to do some processing on the input and return a single value.
%function

$ In contrast, a ___________ is more general and can calculate multiple result values and return them using output and inout type arguments.
%task

$ can contain time-consuming simulation elements such as @, posedge, and others. 
%task

$ are used in all programming languages, generally known as procedures or subroutines.
%task

$ is passed to the task, the processing is done, and the result returned.
%data

$ A _________ must be specifically called with a statement. It cannot be used within an expression as a function can.
%task

$ The keyword ___________ will make the reentrant task.
%automatic

$ Tasks that are declared outside all modules are called ___________.
%global tasks

$ The ___________ should have at least one input argument and cannot have output or inout arguments.
%function

$ ___________ can have zero or more arguments of any type.
